**Welcome To Mad Maps!**

Mad Maps is a powerful, integrated collection of tools to solve all of your Unity terrain pipeline needs. It is a terrain pipeline that is non-destructive, extensible, flexible, fast and modular. It's been battle-tested for the past 2 years in a professional studio environment, used for creating massive open world levels.

It contains 3 integrated toolsets:

The **Terrain Wrapper**: a layer system for the Unity terrain. Useful for seamlessly integrating with existing procedural generation solutions (see below), allowing you to combine procedural generation with handcrafted polish. Organise layers, snapshot and store terrains, create procedural filters, and more.

**World Stamps**: for splitting complex levels up into manageable chunks, and easily modify, store and reuse areas of your world. It's a copy/paste functionality for your entire world.

**Road Networks**: a complete road tool, for easily creating spline-based mesh, object and terrain modifiers. Works seamlessly with the Terrain Wrapper and World Stamp system for a non-destructive workflow. Paint complex road networks, deform the terrain, place/remove objects, and more.

** This fork is currently being updated for unity 2021.2, it generally works, but has not been thoroughly tested **
Known issues:
- Needs new demo assets, some were missing guids, and meshes are misplaced etc. A bit of a mess.
- Stamp Tool Mask Painting Editor window is broken. Leads to not being able to mask, and is a big issue.
